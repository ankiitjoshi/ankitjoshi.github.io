	<h1 ><u><b>What is SQL? </b></u></h1>
	<p>SQL is a language to operate databases; it includes Database Creation, Database Deletion, Fetching Data Rows, Modifying & Deleting Data rows, etc.

		SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database. SQL was developed in the 1970s by IBM Computer Scientists and became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.SQL is the standard language to communicate with Relational Database Systems. All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their Standard Database Language.</p>
	<section>
		In SQL, there are three main types of statements: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).
<dl>
<dt>1. Data Definition Language (DDL):</dt>
<dd>
DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. Common DDL statements include:

CREATE: creates a new database object such as a table, view, index, or constraint.
ALTER: modifies the structure of an existing database object.
DROP: deletes an existing database object.
TRUNCATE: removes all data from a table.
</dd>
<dt>2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):</dt>
<dd>
DML statements are used to manipulate data within the database objects. Common DML statements include:

SELECT: retrieves data from one or more tables.
INSERT: inserts new rows into a table.
UPDATE: modifies existing rows in a table.
DELETE: removes rows from a table.
</dd>
<dt>3. Data Control Language (DCL):</dt>
<dd>
DCL statements are used to control access to the database and its objects. Common DCL statements include:

GRANT: gives a user or group of users access to database objects.
REVOKE: removes access from a user or group of users.
</dd>

<dt>4. Other common SQL statements include:</dt>
<dd>
WHERE: filters rows based on a specified condition.
GROUP BY: groups rows by one or more columns.
HAVING: filters groups based on a specified condition.
ORDER BY: sorts the rows based on one or more columns.
JOIN: combines data from two or more tables based on a related column.
</dd>

</dl>

	<dl>
	<dt>1. CREATE a Table:</dt>
	<p>Create command is used to create the structre of table and specify the variables of the table. </p>
	<dd><pre><code>
	CREATE TABLE employees (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(50),
	last_name VARCHAR(50),
  	department VARCHAR(50),
  	salary DECIMAL(10,2)
	);
		</pre></code></dd>
		<dt>2. INSERT data in Table: </dt>
		<p>This command is used to insert the data in the structure of table.</p>
		<dd><pre>
		<code>
INSERT INTO employees (id, first_name,last_name, department, salary)VALUES
  (1, 'John','Smith', 'Sales', 50000.00),
  (2, 'Jane', 'Doe', 'Marketing', 60000.00),
  (3, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'HR', 55000.00);
		</code>
		</pre>
		</dd>
		<dt>3. DISPLAY the data in table: </dt>
		<p>This command is used to display table.</p>
		<dd>
		<pre>
		<code>
		SELECT * FROM employees;
